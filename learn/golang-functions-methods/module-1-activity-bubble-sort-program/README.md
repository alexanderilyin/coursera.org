The goal of this assignment is to create a routine that sorts a series
of ten integers using the bubble sort algorithm.

This assignment is worth a total of 10 points.

Test the program by running it twice and
testing it with a different sequence of integers each time. The first test
sequence of integers should be all positive numbers and the second test should
have at least one negative number. Give 3 points if the program works correctly
for one test sequence, and give 3 more points if the program works correctly
for the second test sequence.

Examine the code. If the code contains a function
called BubbleSort() which takes a slice of integers as an argument, then
give another 2 points.If the code
contains a function called Swap() function which takes two arguments, a slice of
integers and an index value i, then give another 2 points.
